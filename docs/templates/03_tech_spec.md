# Technical Specification (FE + BE)

**Feature name:**  
**Owner(s):**  
**Date:**  
**Related docs:** Problem Review, UI/UX Review, Figma, tickets  

---

## Overview  
Describe what the feature does, who it impacts, and the success criteria for delivery.  
This section should be understandable by both product and engineering teams.  

---

## Data Model / Schema  
Define the data model(s) this feature will introduce or modify.  

Canonical model (JSON example):  
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "companyId": "uuid",
  "status": "draft|active|archived",
  "config": { "exampleFlag": true, "threshold": 3 },
  "createdAt": "iso8601",
  "updatedAt": "iso8601"
}


**Database changes:**

Table(s): List any new tables or changes to existing tables.

Columns: Define each column, type, constraints, and defaults.

Constraints: Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints.

Indexes: Any new or modified indexes.

Migrations: Outline forward migration steps and rollback plan.


**API Contracts**
Define all endpoints this feature will expose or consume.

Auth / Rate limits / Idempotency:
Specify what authentication is required, rate limits if any, and whether requests should be idempotent.

Endpoint Example

Method / Path: e.g. POST /api/v1/features

Purpose: Why this endpoint exists and what it accomplishes.

Request (JSON): Example payload with required and optional fields.

Response (JSON): Example success response payload.

Errors: List error codes, status codes, and example error responses.

Repeat this structure for each endpoint.

Frontend Requirements

Detail everything required on the frontend side.

Routes and guards: Define URL routes, including role-based or feature-flag access.

Components to build: List new components, forms, modals, lists, etc.

State handling: Document how the UI should behave in loading, empty, success, and error states.

Validation rules: Specify client-side validations and expected error messages.

Analytics/tracking: List events and properties that should be captured for analytics.

Edge Cases

List all edge and negative cases, including how the system should respond.
Examples: invalid inputs, empty datasets, permission denied, network failures, duplicate submissions, concurrent updates.

Observability

Specify how this feature will be monitored and debugged.

Logs: Which fields must be logged (IDs, request params, error codes).

Metrics: KPIs or custom metrics to track (e.g., feature.create.success.count).

Tracing: Required spans or correlation IDs for distributed tracing.

Dependencies

List all internal or external dependencies required for this feature.

Dependency	Type (Service/Library/Env/Feature Flag)	Owner	Status (Ready/Blocked)
Example: Payments API	Service	Backend Team	Ready
Example: Feature flag enable-new-flow	Feature Flag	DevOps	Blocked

Include services, libraries, environment variables, third-party APIs, or other features that must be delivered first.

Risks

Document known risks to delivery or stability, with mitigation strategies.

Risk	Impact (Low/Med/High)	Probability (Low/Med/High)	Mitigation
Example: State API latency	High	Medium	Add retry + fallback
Example: Schema migration error	Medium	Low	Test rollback on staging

Consider technical, operational, security, and compliance risks.
